<h4>Memory Allocation Simulator (Python – GUI)</h4>h4>

A **Memory Allocation Simulator** built using **Python (Tkinter GUI)** that demonstrates how memory management works in an **Operating System** using classic allocation strategies.

This project visually simulates:
- First Fit
- Best Fit
- Worst Fit  
memory allocation techniques.
